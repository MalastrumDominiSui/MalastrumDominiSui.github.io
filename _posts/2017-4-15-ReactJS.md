Recently I met with a professional who insisted that ReactJS is one of the languages that improves web-developers _hireability_ more recently. I had been meaning to look at, (and some of my programming neighbors are doing some pretty awesome stuff with it). I had already looked at GraphQL and Dataloader, and I was pleased to find that React is yet another brainchild of the prolific programmers at Facebook. Deployed in 2012, it has an accelerated uptake in interest:

Just so there is no confusion, AngularJS is to ReactJS as Apples are to Kumquats. That is to say: Angular is a full MVC framework, but ReactJS is only the Views. My reason for graphing the two was only to find some metric to help me decide between which two to look at this weekend.

I decided to dive straight into ReactJS. I ran through an excellent tutorial on <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> this weekend, and here are some takeways.

#### What is React? Why should I learn it?

Again, React is strictly the V portion of MVC. Aside from this, the really unique feature that makes React stand out is how _fast_ it is.  The main driving factor is that React is based on only updating DOM elements that have _changed_.  Thus the name "React".  Codecademy has a great article on how React does this via the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-virtual-dom">Virtual DOM</a>.

Many developers could intuit why this works so well: for example if you have ever viewed a full DOM object in developer tools: <code>Document.getElementsByClassName("insert_class_on_page")</code>.<br>
Here you will totally see the __massive__ amount of nested elements you will find in each DOM object. It has a list of _hundreds_ of properties. e.g:

{% highlight javascript %}
div.content-body
	accessKey:""
	align:""
	assignedSlot:
	...
	.....

	title:""
	translate:true
	webkitdropzone:""
{% endhighlight %}

One can imagine that doing any generation or manipulation of objects this large could be costly. React makes a virtual DOM, which is a super lightweight version of this. The process of determining which virtual DOM objects have changed is called _diffing_.

To think about the exact process React goes through, it goes like this: 

- A JSX element renders. (An element combining Javascript and HTML)
- The entire virtual DOM updates.
- The virtual DOM "diffs," comparing its current self with its previous self.
- Part of the real DOM updates.
- The screen looks different than it used to.

As I mentioned previously: The reason React is so much faster than Javascript is that React isolates only the DOM objects that have changed.

At the top of every React script are at least two lines you need to start off:

{% highlight javascript %}
var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
{% endhighlight %}

These store javascript objects.  The first line is a javascript _library_ that gives us React methods, the second line gives us _other_ methods directly related to the DOM, such as <code>ReactDOM.render</code>.

#### Some Important Takeaways and Terms

__JSX Expression__ - this is the basic unit of ReactJS. Essentially it is HTML contained within a Javascript object.
 
JSX expressions can have _attributes_ (like alt="", id="", etc) just like HTML, but __"class"__ has to be __"className"__, since React is compiled into Javascript, and Javascript reserves "class" as a special word. Another difference is that self-closing tags like &lt;br&gt; need to have a forward slash in them: &lt;br/&gt;.

- JSX expressions must have a single outer containing element.

__ReactDOM -__ name of a JS library containing React Specific methods, all dealing with the DOM

__ReactDOM.render -__ the most common way to render JSX expressions, accepts two args, a _JSX expression_ and a _DOM element_.  This second arg is used to place the JSX expression. Specifically, the JSX is appended to the second arg. Like this:

{% highlight javascript%}
ReactDOM.render(
	<MyComponentClass />, 
	document.getElementById('app')
);
{% endhighlight %}

__diffing -__ the process of determining whether objects on the virtual DOM have changed or not.

__ReactJS is compiled -__ in order to run in a browser, React must be compiled into Javascript.  Using curly braces within a JSX expression allows a programmer to interpolate JSX and straight Javascript together! For example:
{% highlight javascript%}
var myJSX = (
	<div> 5 + 5 = {5 + 5} </div>
)
{% endhighlight %}

This would display __5 + 5 = 10__ when rendered.

__Conditional logic -__ You cannot use and "if" statement within these curly braces.  There are other options to express this logic in React.

__keys -__  when building list items in react, you may or may not need keys.  If you are building a list of checked off items, that needs a memory from one render to the next.

__component -__ A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job. That job is often to render some HTML.

__component class -__ Every component comes from a component class.  The component class is like a stamp that generate components. Create one using the method <code>React.createClass</code>
