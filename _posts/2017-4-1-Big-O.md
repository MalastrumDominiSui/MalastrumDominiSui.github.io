Other than being the title of a fascinating Batman/Evangelion hybrid show on Cartoon Network, __Big O__ is a important way to talk about __performant code__. Even coders who _flee in terror_ at the mention of Calculus should find a way to talk about this. It could easily set you ahead in an interview, and help you approach algorithms in a more knowledgable way.

Recently this video caught my eye: An interview with a software engineer at Google. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKu_SEDAykw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

There is a point where the interviewee begins to list solutions and _relate_ them to __mathematical slope functions__: _linear, quadratic, logarithmic, etc._ Using this knowledge he is able to determine whether his solution more or less _performant_.

This concept of performance is referred to as the __Big O__. Here is an overview:<br>
<ul>
	<li><strong>O(1)</strong> <em> - constant</em></li>
	<li><strong>O(N)</strong><em> - linear</em></li>
	<li><strong>O(N<sup>2</sup>)</strong><em> - quadratic</em></li>
	<li><strong>O(2<sup>N</sup></strong><em> - exponential</em></li>
	<li><strong>O(log N)</strong><em> - logarithmic</em></li>
</ul>

#### Into the math...

So the most simple function is a __constant function__ <code>x = 4</code>

This always evaluates to 4, no matter where it is evaluated.

<div style="float:right; margin-right:200px; ">
	<code>
		f(0) = 4 <br>
		f(1) = 4 <br>
		f(2) = 4 <br>
		f(4) = 4 <br>
		f(8) = 4 <br>
	</code>
</div>

![constant](/assets/pics/constant.png){:height="300px" width="300px"}

<div style="clear:right"></div>

So in this case _f(1), f(2)_ represent a program with an input that increases, like an array with one more item, or a loop that runs one more time.  With a __constant__ Big O, the _data overhead_ and the _computation time_ will remain constant.

In ruby this might look like:

{% highlight ruby %}
def constant(arr)
	return "blah"
end
{% endhighlight%}

Here it doesn't matter if the array is empty, or googolplex elements long, this function will always return the string "blah". We refer to this function as having __Order 1__ or __O(1)__.

The next function is __linear__: for example the equation <code>y = x</code>, or if you prefer <code>f(x) = x</code>

A linear graph looks like this:

<div style="float:right; margin-right:200px;">
	<code>
		f(0) = 0 <br>
		f(1) = 1 <br>
		f(2) = 2 <br>
		f(4) = 4 <br>
		f(8) = 8 <br>
	</code>
</div>

![linear](/assets/pics/linear.png){:height="300px" width="300px"}

<div style="clear:right"></div>

A function with linear order is a function that grows equal in __computation time__ and/or __data consumption__ in a linear fashion. Each additional input to the function will add an equal amount of time and resource consumption to the function.

In Ruby, an example of this would be: <br>

{% highlight ruby %}
def stringToCat (strArr)
	strArr.map do |string|
		string = "cat"
	end
end
{%endhighlight%}

For each additional string added to <code>strArr</code>, the function would iterate one additional time, and take one additional amount of space.  Thus we say the function stringToCat is _Order N_ or _O(N)_ .

Next there __quadratic Big O__, where the equation is <code>y = x<sup>2</sup></code>.  The equation grows faster:

<div style="float:right; margin-right:200px;">
	<code>
		f(0) = 0 <br>
		f(1) = 1 <br>
		f(2) = 4 <br>
		f(4) = 16 <br>
		f(8) = 32 <br>
	</code>
</div>

![quadratic](/assets/pics/quadratic.png){:height="300px" width="300px"}

<div style="clear:right"></div>

A good example of this type of function would be a function that contains two loops, with the second nested inside the first:

{% highlight ruby %}
def catLetter (strArr)
	strArr.map do |string|
		string.chars.map do |char|
			char = "cat"
		end
	end
end
{% endhighlight%}

 To put this simply: by adding __x__ more strings to our input, we have to do __x &middot; x = x<sup>2</sup>__ more iterations for each additional string. The order of this would be __O(N<sup>2</sup>)__ or __quadratic__.

 Not much increases more quickly than an __exponential function__.  If you haven't seen one yet, here it is:<br>
 <code> y = 2<sup>x</sup></code>

<div style="float:right; margin-right:200px;">
	<code>
		f(0) = 1 <br>
		f(1) = 2 <br>
		f(2) = 4 <br>
		f(4) = 16 <br>
		f(8) = 256 <br>
	</code>
</div>

![exponential](/assets/pics/exponential.png){:height="400px" width="400px"}

<div style="clear:right"></div>

It is almost identical to a quadratic when we start out, but after _f(4)_ it grows crazy fast. Pictured here is exponential in red, and quadratic in blue.

A good example of a program with __exponential Big O__ is a Fibonacci calculator. In ruby it could look like:

{% highlight ruby %}
def fibonacci( n )
  return  n  if ( 0..1 ).include? n
  ( fibonacci( n - 1 ) + fibonacci( n - 2 ) )
end
{% endhighlight%}

This program grows like a weed as you increase __n__.  There is so much overhead involved in this decievingly simple algorithm that you would hope to never have to rely on it for large inputs of __n__.

Lastly we have __logarithmic functions__.  This is an exponential function flipped on it's side.  In other words, it barely increases the more you run it.

<div style="float:right; margin-right:200px;">
	<code>
		f(1) = 0 <br>
		f(2) = 0.69 <br>
		f(3) = 1.10 <br>
		f(4) = 1.38 <br>
		f(8) = 2.07 <br>
	</code>
</div>

![logarithmic](/assets/pics/logarithmic.png){:height="400px" width="400px"}

<div style="clear:right"></div>

Algorithms that end up having logarithmic increases in time and space usually have some pretty clever solutions.  One of the most common logarithmic algorithms is called __binary search__.  It is basically a way of searching for a value in an ordered set by cutting that set in half each iteration to narrow the search.

Sometimes functions may have many moving pieces, just like functions in math.  It is not easy to determine the Big O of complex functions, but the short answer is that the piece that has the _highest_ Big O determines the _entire_ Big O for the function.

The last step of this process is to confirm this and try your own functions.  If you use ruby like I did in all these examples you can use the line 'require benchmark' to actual measure how different algorithms perform against each other. Check it out: <br>
