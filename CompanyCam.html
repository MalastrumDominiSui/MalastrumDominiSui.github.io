					<h3>Web Developer. Worker. Entrepeneur.</h3>

					<p>I started out killing lawn grubs, now I search for full-stack bugs. I know what it's like to dump my landscaping photos into a jumbled heap of company files on Google Drive. I am always looking out for the user, because I've <em>been</em> that user. I've worked tirelessly with the same people that have their mucky fingers sliding across your mobile pages. I wouldn't just have the ability to develop your code, but to have passion for the product from all ends.</p>
				
					<h3>Outside of Work?</h3>

					<p>If I'm not at work, you will find me splitting my time between my family, the gym, gaming, 3d modeling&amp;printing, and working on my side business <a href="https://www.terrainify.com/">Terrainify</a>. If I get to do those all in one day, it's been a <em>really good day</em>. I am driven by my passion. Ideas and innovation are an unbeatable fuel, whether they come from myself, or someone else. I enjoy and thrive when I can brainstorm, even if it means learning an entirely new skill set. I love a startup atmosphere for this exact reason. I am familiar with the pain and the joy, success and failure, and I am thirsty for more.</p>

				<div class="flex-column">
					<h3>Why CompanyCam?</h3>

					<p>It means a lot to me that CompanyCam emerged from your founder’s hard earned experience in the roofing industry--not just from a stab at some untapped market. Your backstory’s impact shows, as there are a lot of apps on the market but none offering the experience that you do.  I love that when I downloaded the app to try it out, Kelly called me up right away for some human-to-human followup. You value your customers, and you take your tech seriously. I bet you’re proud that you’re solving a problem that even Google Drive hasn’t solved yet. I want to be a part of the kind of team you’re building.</p>

					<h3>Who do you need?</h3>

					<p>You need a hero, and a versitile team player.  Being a startup means that things are still organic.  With less than a dozen employees you need someone who can not only code, but take on any obstacle head first.  Someone who isn't afraid to voice a his ideas, but won't blindly stick to them, either. You need someone who can work harmoniously, in good times and bad, and recover quickly from the bad times.</p>

			<div class="gutter">
				<h3 class="text-center">I want to be that guy.</h3>

				<p> I know that kicking off with Company Cam would be not a only a good fit, but the greatest career challenge I've had. I didn't say it would be easy, but I am ready to take it on. I look forward to <em>learning</em> from your experience, and offering my own. Perhaps one day I will finally recognize this mythical Russian grunting man in the bathroom by his shoes(if not by his smell).</p>
