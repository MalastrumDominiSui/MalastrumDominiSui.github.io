					<h3><em>Web Developer. Worker. Entrepeneur.</em></h3>

					<p>I started out killing lawn grubs, now I search for full-stack bugs. I have an eye for detail, and I am always looking out for the user, because I've <em>been</em> that user. I know that the complexity of content on university websites can lead to endless catacombs of drop down menus, ineffective "search" features, and an overall confusing user experience. I wouldn't just have the ability to develop your code, but to create a better experience for all users of the site.</p>
				
					<h3><em>Outside of Work?</em></h3>

					<p>If I'm not at work, you will find me splitting my time between my family, the gym, gaming, 3d modeling &amp; printing, and working on my side business <a href="https://www.terrainify.com/">Terrainify</a>. If I get to do those all in one day, it's been a <em>really good day</em>. I am driven by my passion. Ideas and innovation are an unbeatable fuel, whether they come from myself, or someone else. I enjoy and thrive when I can brainstorm, even if it means learning an entirely new skill set.</p>

				<div class="flex-column">
					<h3><em>Why Creighton?</em></h3>

					<p>Creighton is an incredible community, with a lot of moving parts. You have the students, sports, research, events, and much more. All of these parts need a top-tier web representation. You have a strong Jesuit identity, which means you have a mission to share your gifts and talents, and learn from others. Your student numbers are going up, but you want to grow <em>smart</em>. Part of this means being efficient by hiring the right people.</p>

					<h3><em>Who do you need?</em></h3>

					<p>You want someone who knows about what it means to approach a web feature with <em>consideration</em>. You want to be able to publish foolproof features, with no large hiccups. This means you need a team that values version control as well as testing. You want someone who can help make the user experience on the graduate portion of the site as best as possible, whether it's by reducing repetitive links, fixing unexpected style behavior, or drying up your back-end code.</p>

				<h3 class="text-center">I want to be that guy.</h3>

				<p> I know that kicking off with Creighton would be not a only a good fit, but the greatest career challenge I've had. I didn't say it would be easy, but I am ready to take it on. I look forward to <em>learning</em> from your experience, and offering my own.</p>
