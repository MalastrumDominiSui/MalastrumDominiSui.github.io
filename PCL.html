					<h3>Web Developer. Worker. Entrepeneur.</h3>

					<p>I started out killing lawn grubs, now I search for full-stack bugs. I sweated my ass off, and I know what it's like to drop my landscaping photos into the bottomless pit of Google Drive. I am always looking out for the user, because I've <em>been</em> that user. I've worked tirelessly with the same people that have their mucky fingers sliding across your mobile pages. I wouldn't just have the ability to develop your code, but to have passion for the product from all ends.</p>
				
					<h3>What the heck else?</h3>

					<p>If I'm not at work, you will find me splitting my time between my amazing family, working out, gaming, 3d printing and modeling, and working on my side business <a href="https://www.terrainify.com/">Terrainify</a>. If I get to do those all in one day, it's been a <em>really good day</em>. I am driven by my passion. Ideas and innovation are an unbeatable fuel, whether they come from myself, or someone else. I enjoy and thrive when I can brainstorm new methods, even if it means learning an entirely new skill set. I love a startup atmosphere for this exact reason. I am familiar with the pain and the joy, success and failure, and I am thirsty for more.</p>

					<h3>What do I know about you?</h3>

					<p>You've been around since the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141217025158/http://companycam.com/">end of 2014</a>. Your app has <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilx.companycam&hl=en">4 stars on 29 reviews</a>, and you aren't satisfied there.  You have had a <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=companyCam">busy year</a>. You are doing what those clowns at google drive can't seem to accomplish. The decision to create CompanyCam wasn't just a stab at an untapped market: rather it was based on your founder's hard earned experience in the in roofing industry. There are a lot of apps on the market, but none are offering exactly what you are, and you want and need to stay ahead of the game.</p>

					<h3>Who do you need?</h3>

					<p>You need a hero, and a versitile team player.  Being a startup means that things are still organic.  With less than a dozen employees you need someone who can not only code, but take on any obstacle head first.  Someone who isn't afraid to voice a his ideas, but won't blindly stick to them, either. You need someone who can work harmoniously, in good times and bad, and recover quickly from the bad times.</p>

					<h3>If we build it, they will come.</h3>

					<p>I want to take ownership. I know that kicking off with Company Cam would be the most exciting job I could ask for so far, and the greatest career challenge I've had. I didn't say it would be easy, but I am ready to take it on headfirst. Reading your job description I already felt welcome, and I look forward to the day when I can recognize this mythical Russian grunting man in the bathroom by his shoes(if not by his smell).</p>
