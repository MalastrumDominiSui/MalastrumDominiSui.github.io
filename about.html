	 <p class="dark article">Welcome to my new website! In 2016 I was ecstatic to join Omaha Code School. This personal web-site is the result of my newest and growing skill set: web-development. I'm using it as a platform to promote my own growth, my skills, business ventures, and anything else I can think of. I'm having a lot of fun with it.</p>

	<p class="dark article">I have both a logical side, and a creative side. My Myers-Briggs has always pinned me as an ENFP, but I seem to walk the line on each of the indices. Apparently my strongest preference is about 25% weighted towards Feeling. However - the temptation to allow a test to brand people can limit our understanding of their potential. I strongly maintain that there is no test that can fully determine anyone's personality, but rather us who self-determine the results.  Of course... I could have borrowed that idea from a conversation with a friend who was more a "T" than I am.</p> <hr>

	 <p class="dark article">I'm a worker, a dreamer, and a growing entrepeneur.  Since 2015 I have self-taught myself the nuances of 3D printing and design.  I collaborated with my friend John and brainstormed an idea into existence.  The result was Terrainify, wonderful handcrafted terrain for table-top gamers. I designed all the pieces in software, and we've sold over almost 200 pieces in less than a year, and it has been a blast! Check it out here:</p>
