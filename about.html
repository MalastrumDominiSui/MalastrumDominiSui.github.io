	<p class="dark article">My name is Michael Sefranek, if that wasn't clear by the header. I suppose I should write something about me here. Ok then:<br><br> I have both a logical side, and an artistic side. For 5 years following college I worked as a lawncare tech for a major company. Despite feeling like a cog in the machine, I paid attention and grew in my understanding of work efficiency, business mechanics, leadership, mechanical aptitude, and how to anticipate and set good customer expectations.</p>

	 <p class="dark article">I'm a worker, a dreamer, and a growing entrepeneur.  Since 2015 I have self-taught myself the art (and science) of both 3D printing and 3D modeling. I designed all the pieces for a small business making 3D printed terrain for miniature gamers. We've sold over 100 pieces in less than a year, and it has been a blast! Check it out here:</p>

	 <p class="dark article">In 2016 I was ecstatic to join Omaha Code School. This personal web-site is the result of my newest and growing skill set: web-development. I'm using it as a platform to promote my own growth, my skills, and my business ventures. Most importantly: I'm having a lot of fun with it.  Thanks for stopping by!</p>
